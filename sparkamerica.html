            <p>SparkAmerica is focused on building Fit & Healthy leaders all across the country. We do that by implementing programs in SparkCities - urban and suburban localities whose business and civic leaders have joined with us to create community and promote healthy living. We are proud of the work being done and the partnerships we've formed in each of these cities, and of the friendly competition we see each year as they strive to be the healthiest SparkCity in America!</p>
